## Resources
I utilized the week 4 activities folder, google, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array, https://www.w3schools.com/js/, my tutor, and the TA's in class. 

## Description
I created a javascript quiz completely from scratch, I dynamically created the questions, answers, and the timer. The user is also able to store their scores in localStorage and clear the saved highscores.
